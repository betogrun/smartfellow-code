SmartFellow

At the moment, SmartFellow is a web app that shows the user's current position in a map on OpenLayers. SmartFellow acesses GPSD to retrieve gps data.

SmartFellow needs gpsd up and running to display user's current position. For information on how to build, install and use GPSD see:
 http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpsd/trunk/INSTALL

Some webserver is also necessary. Most distros delivers Apache by default.

See the INSTALL file to get SmartFellow working
